The ``text_indentation`` module
==========================

Using ``text_indentation``
---------------------

First import ``text_indentation`` from the ``5-text_indentation`` file:
    >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation

Tests:

    Test - Regular Text
    >>> text = "Why is Twice named Twice? The group will touch people's hearts twice: once through the ears, and once again through the eyes. Also Mina is number 1"
    >>> text_indentation(text)
    Why is Twice named Twice?

    The group will touch people's hearts twice:

    once through the ears, and once again through the eyes.

    Also Mina is number 1.

    Test - Missing Argument
    >>> text = "Why is Twice named Twice? The group will touch people's hearts twice: once through the ears, and once again through the eyes. Also Mina is number 1"
    >>> text_indentation()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
